1. The best practice would be to implement a life cycle rule

2. For data that is not accessed frequently, Amazon S3 Glacier is recommended. It provides secure, durable, and low-cost storage for data archiving and long-term backup.

Cost of transferring files to Glacier
- **Scenario 1: Data Transfer Cost is Free (within the same region)**
  - Data Transfer Cost: Free
  - Total Cost for 50 TB: 50,000 GB = $0

- **Scenario 2: Data Transfer Cost is $0.01 per GB**
  - Data Transfer Cost: $0.01 per GB
  - Total Cost for 50 TB: 50,000 GB * $0.01 = $500

- **Request Costs**:
  - PUT/COPY/POST/LIST Requests: $0.02 per 1,000 requests
  - Number of Files: 20,000,000,000 files
  - Total Requests Cost: (20,000,000,000 / 1,000) * $0.02 = $400000

### Total Cost for Transferring Files to Glacier
- **Scenario 1**:
  - Data Transfer Cost: $0
  - Request Costs: $400,000
  - Total Cost: $400000

- **Scenario 2**:
  - Data Transfer Cost: $500
  - Request Costs: $400000
  - Total Cost: $400,500

### Monthly Storage Cost Comparison
- S3 Standard: $0.023 per GB
- S3 Glacier: $0.004 per GB

### Monthly Cost for 50 TB
- S3 Standard: 50,000 GB * $0.023 = $1,150
- S3 Glacier: 50,000 GB * $0.004 = $200

### Summary
- **Scenario 1**:
  - Data Transfer Cost: $0
  - Request Costs: $400000
  - Monthly Storage Cost in S3 Standard: $1,150
  - Monthly Storage Cost in S3 Glacier: $200
  - By transferring the data to S3 Glacier, we will incur a one-time request cost of $400000, but we will significantly reduce the monthly storage cost from $1,150 to $200.

- **Scenario 2**:
  - Data Transfer Cost: $500
  - Request Costs: $400,000
  - Monthly Storage Cost in S3 Standard: $1,150
  - Monthly Storage Cost in S3 Glacier: $200
  - By transferring the data to S3 Glacier, we will incur a one-time transfer cost of $500 and a request cost of $400000 but we will still reduce the monthly storage cost from $1,150 to $200.
